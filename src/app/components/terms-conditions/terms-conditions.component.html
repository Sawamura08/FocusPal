        <h1 class="title">Purpose of the App</h1>
        <p>
          The App has been created as part of an academic capstone project. The
          primary purpose of the App is to evaluate whether using a task
          management system can help users improve their productivity. By
          tracking task completion, setting reminders, and monitoring user
          engagement, we aim to assess the effectiveness of task management
          systems in enhancing personal productivity and time management.
        </p>
        <p>
          All information and features provided in the App are solely for
          research and educational purposes, with the goal of understanding how
          users interact with task management systems and how such tools can
          potentially increase efficiency in daily activities.
